## Backend Design Choices

### Entities Used

- User
- Post
- Comment
- Reply
- Thread

All the design decisions for users and threads are straightforward. Particularly for post comments and replies (1-level comments), we use an `array of replies`, which is of type `Comment`, to store the replies of a comment.

## APIs

### Authentication

- **Login**: When a user logs in, we generate a JWT token and return it in the cookies to the user.
- **Logout**: The JWT token is invalidated or cleared from the cookies.
- **Protected Routes**: For every subsequent request, the client sends the token with it to authenticate itself for all the protected routes. `Middleware`
